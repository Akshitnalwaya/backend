Nodemon is a utility tool for Node.js development that:

- Monitors your project files for any changes  
- Automatically restarts your Node.js application when changes are detected  
- Eliminates the need to manually restart the server after code modifications  
- Improves development workflow efficiency

## Installation

```bash
# local project installation
npm install nodemon --save-dev

# global installation
npm install -g nodemon


 Key Concepts for Connecting to a Database

When working with any database (DB), there are two fundamental ideas to keep in mind:

---

## 1. Error Handling  
Always anticipate that something can go wrong when you try to connect. Use a **`try...catch`** block to gracefully catch and handle any errors:

```js
async function connectDB() {
  try {
    const connection = await db.connect()
    console.log('✔️ Connected to the database')
    return connection
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('❌ Database connection failed:', error)
    // handle or re-throw the error as needed
    throw error
  }
}
Important terms:

try

catch

Error / Exception

2. Asynchronous Operations
Connecting to a DB typically involves I/O that doesn’t complete instantly. You use async functions together with await to write clear, linear-style code that waits for the connection to succeed or fail:

js
Copy
Edit
// mark the function as asynchronous
async function startApp() {
  // pause here until db.connect() resolves or rejects
  const dbConn = await connectDB()
  // now you can safely use dbConn...
}
Important terms:

async

await

Asynchronous / I/O

Summary of Key Terms

Term	Description
Database	A structured store of data you can connect to and query.
Connection	The link your code opens to talk with the database.
try...catch	JavaScript construct for handling errors.
async	Marks a function as asynchronous (returns a Promise).
await	Pauses execution until a Promise resolves or rejects.
Error	An exception thrown when something goes wrong.
