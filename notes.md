Nodemon is a utility tool for Node.js development that:

Monitors your project files for any changes
Automatically restarts your Node.js application when changes are detected
Eliminates the need to manually restart the server after code modifications
Improves development workflow efficiency

Installation
npm install nodemon --save-dev   # local project installation
npm install -g nodemon           # global installation
Usage
Instead of:
node index.js
Use:
nodemon index.js
This simple change saves time and makes the development process smoother by providing immediate feedback as you code.
